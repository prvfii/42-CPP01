    Deepening C++ Basics: Understanding memory, references, and more.

______________________________________________________________________________

Description

CPP Module 01 is the second project in the 42 C++ Piscine series. This module builds upon the foundational concepts learned in CPP Module 00 and introduces new topics critical to understanding C++ programming. The focus is on memory management, references, pointers, and further exploration of classes and objects.

This project emphasizes writing clean, modular code while adhering to C++ best practices.

Topics Covered

	•	Memory and Pointers:
	•	The use of pointers and references.
	•	Differences between pointers and references.
	•	Dynamic memory allocation (new and delete).
	•	Classes and Instances:
	•	Creating and managing multiple instances of a class.
	•	Understanding the importance of constructors and destructors.
	•	Strings and Arrays:
	•	Working with C++ strings and string streams.
	•	Basics of arrays in C++.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Using const for safety and clarity.
	•	Avoiding memory leaks through proper memory management.
